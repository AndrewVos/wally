Gherkin is a great way to write feature files to describe the behaviour of your application but the

* It has no mobile view
* It's private & requires a log in, which is a massive pain on a Nokia C3-00
* Tags can be made more useful - Eg, cuts of all tags marked '@touch'
* I can't hyperlink my step definitions
